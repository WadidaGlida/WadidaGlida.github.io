              Gilbert Beilschmidt was like any self-respecting college student,
              in that his favorite thing in the world was sleep. He had
              purposefully scheduled no classes before 9am, so he could get to
              classes without being a zombie. He was pissed as hell at whoever
              thought it was a good idea to wake him up at this ungodly hour. He
              didn’t even know what time it was, he was already mad as he made
              his way to the door.

              "Sure." Mimi raised herself on tiptoe and reached up. Heather bent
              to check on the oven. She usually grabbed a chair if she needed
              anything from the highest shelves, or asked Jake, if he was
              around. However, the clumping noises upstairs indicated he'd only
              just woken up after coming home late last night and was headed for
              the shower. And Mimi was a couple inches taller than Heather was,

              It’s creepy how it feels like time is repeating itself when he
              sees Liam’s face in front of his door again. And Liam feels it
              repeating again when Bryce looks at him like that. You would think
              after everyone got home, safe and well, Bryce would want to at
              least give a short phone call. But no. So obviously, Liam knocks
              on his door.
