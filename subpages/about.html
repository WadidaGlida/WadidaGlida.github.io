            I know you. Your voice. That smile. Still there was a nagging in her
            head that it was completely nonsensical. But it was not impossible.
            Jon Snow, the high school nerd and the boy next door whom she went
            to school with since the sixth grade and her brother’s best friend -
            could actually be the one the city called ‘Spiderman’? I know that
            smirk. And those lips. Why wouldn’t she? She’s had a silly crush on
            Jon for years now, and nobody knew about it. Perhaps, best kept that
            way. “You have a knack for getting in trouble, young lady.” Sansa
            laughed and swept her rain soaked hair away from her face as she
            slowly made her way to her masked hero. It was the second time this
            month, he had come to her rescue. Well, I’ve been a busy girl, she
            laments. “And you have a knack for saving me out of trouble. Always
            at the right place at the right time… I wonder why that is,” Sansa
            pouts playfully. What a night it had been for her; first was the bad
            audition she wished she hadn’t taken off shift for and then being
            followed and cornered in an alley by two punks looking for easy
            money. And all the while, she sensed she was being watched, by
            someone.
