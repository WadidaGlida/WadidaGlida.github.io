            The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test
            that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter
            pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The
            running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you
            hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time
            you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run
            as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap
            before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word
            start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start. ding

            the bathroom. Which led him to quickly get up and skip over there,
            after all, ‘UAE’s star rider injured’ didn’t seem like a headline
            all over the media that Marc wanted to deal with. “Oh my god. Put it
            away. Put it away,” the door swung right open and revealed a
            frightened Tadej running into the main room and jumping onto his
            bed. The younger one seemed fine, physically at least, so Marc
            watched things unfold for a moment before coming back to his senses
            and seeing what got the other all riled up. He took a small breath
            before entering the crime scene, preparing himself to find the
            worst. However, as he began looking around the room, he found
            nothing. Okay, well there was a small spider there, but nothing out
            of the ordinary. ‘UAE’s star rider afraid of Catalunya’s smallest
            spider’ That’d make for a funny headline. “Aquí arañita,” Marc said
            as he bent down to gently pick up the small creature and quickly
            enclosed it between his hands. “I thought somebody died in here, but
